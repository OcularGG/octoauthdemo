                <h2>05 Jun 3301 - CMDR Litefootz</h2>
                <p>I'm a visionary, not just a leader. I chose the title "Litefootz" because it represents agility and foresight. My vision is to create a community of explorers who are always ready to assist and innovate. Whether it's providing fuel or sharing knowledge, we are here to support each other.</p>
                
                <p>But thank you for the idea.</p>
                
                <p>This initiative is going to evolve (I hope) and I'm concerned that it may become unwieldy (if it does, it'll evolve more). My original vision was that someone would lead all the explorers and we'd go find them. But that's a lot of friend requests (Thanks CMDRs for your amazing support. I salute you!).</p>
                
                <p>I think a couple of things:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>This is just going to become a long thread for now. If someone needs fuel and posts here, we can swarm to help, or fold our...</li>
